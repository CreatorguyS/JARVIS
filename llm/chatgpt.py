Each extension function can be invoked directly by calling its corresponding Python function. If the extension requires any input parameters, provide them as arguments to the function call.
Here's an example of how to use an extension:
Suppose you want to use the extension1 extension:
'''python
from extensions.extension1 import extension1
# If extension1 requires parameters, provide them as arguments
result = extension1(param1, param2)
'''
Replace param1, param2, etc., with the actual parameters required by the extension.
Now, feel free to utilize any extension whenever needed by providing corresponding Python code only.
